Java Thread Priority in Multithreading

Java works within a multithreading environment in which a thread scheduler assigns the processor to a thread based on the priority of thread.
Whenever we create a thread in Java, it always has some priority assigned to it.
Priority can either be given by JVM while creating the thread or it can be given by the programmer explicitly. 

Priorities in threads is a concept where each thread is having a priority which in layman’s language one can say every object is having priority here which is represented by numbers ranging from 1 to 10. 
The default priority is set to 5 as excepted.
Minimum priority is set to 1.
Maximum priority is set to 10.

Here 3 constants are defined in it namely as follows:

public static int NORM_PRIORITY
public static int MIN_PRIORITY
public static int MAX_PRIORITY

how to get and set priority of a thread in java. 

public final int getPriority(): java.lang.Thread.getPriority() 
method returns priority of given thread.

public final void setPriority(int newPriority): java.lang.Thread.setPriority() 
method changes the priority of thread to the value newPriority. 
This method throws IllegalArgumentException if value of parameter newPriority goes beyond minimum(1) and maximum(10) limit.
